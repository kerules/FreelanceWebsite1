		<p class="nine" > The investment strategy of Emperio Diamond Enterprise is to invest in properties that are distressed and 
		undervalued. These properties are targeted because they are currently underutilized under current management and ownership. 
		Before the company invests in any property, they are throroughly vetted to meet company requirements. These standard procedures 
		allows us to select properties that we know will maximize our returns and minimize the risks that are entailed in the short and 
		long terms.  </p>

		are in a upward trend. This is done by making relationships with key members of the city and neighborhood. Thus allowing us to 
		gauge and predict future developments and investment safety of the said properties that we intend to invest in.</p>
		<p class="ten" >	•  Property Analysis / Financial Breakdown:	</p>
		<p class= "nine" >  Property Analysis is done to understand why a said property should be invested in compared to another property.
		We look into why that property is currently being underutilized and how we can make sure to maximize the full potential of the 
		property. As well as other factors such as the cost of not only purchasing the property in a reasonable price but also the cost 
		of making sure that the property can be fully utilized as well as functional. Also, analyzing different financial statements and ratios 
		to get a clear picture of past, current, and future revenues, cash flows, and expenses.thus illustrating the viability of acquiring
		a property.</p>
